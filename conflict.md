# Demonstrate the repair of a conflict

## Scenario

At 1:00 pm on a given day, Lucas, using GitHub Desktop, pulls down the latest and greatest of a repo using the Pull Origin button. Then he edits one file (file1.md) trusting that other authors are working on the file. At 1:15 pm that same day he saves his edits, then uses the Commit to main button to push the edit back to the central GitHub repo. All seams well.

At 1:05 pm on that same day, David also pulls the origin updates using GitHub Desktop, and edits away on file1.md, then committing his update to the file at 1:20 pm. His mistake was to not check, or possibly ignoring that file1.md had changed prior to his push, creating a conflict.

Task: Document this scenario, and demonstrate the conflict repair.
