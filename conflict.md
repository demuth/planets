# Demonstrate the repair of a conflicth

## Scenario

At 1:00 pm on a given day, Martha, using GitHub Desktop, pulls down the latest and greatest using the Pull Origin button. Then she edits one file (file1.md) from a repo trusting that other authors are working on the file. At 1:15 pm that same day she saves her edits, then uses the Commit to main button to push the edit back to the central GitHub repo.

At 1:05 pm on that same day, Alex also pulls the origin updates using GitHub Desktop, and edits away, then committing his update to the file at 1:20 pm. His mistake was to not check, or ignore that file1.md had changed, prior to his push.

Task: Document this scenario, and demonstrate the repair.
